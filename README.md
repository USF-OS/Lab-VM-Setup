# Setting up a Virtual Machine

In this lab, we'll set up a VM (virtual machine) for you to use for the
remainder of the semester.

Before you get started, please make sure you can log in to the CS network
machines. (`ssh USERNAME@stargate.cs.usfca.edu`). If you can't, contact
CS support in person or via email (support@cs.usfca.edu).

**Windows Users**: you'll need a terminal to go through this guide. You
can install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
to get a Linux terminal, or you can install
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and use its built-in
terminal and SSH client.

## Setup Guide

Use the [VM Setup Guide](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/vm-setup.html)
to create your shiny new virtual machine. **Please read the instructions
carefully**. There is plenty of time to complete the lab, so don't rush it.

**Lab Notes**: as you go through the guide, you will find that the setup process can be broken down
into a handful of larger conceptual steps. For example, the first thing you'll do is create
"virtual hardware" with a CPU, memory, disk etc. Take notes on what you're doing as you go through
the steps. You will need the notes for the next part of the lab.

## Team Notebook

As mentioned above, you should take notes on what you did to set up your VM and if you ran into
any issues or new commands. Once all the members in your group are done, you should write a small
document explaining the VM setup at a high level. What were the major steps you took? What was
their purpose? We will discuss these as a class.

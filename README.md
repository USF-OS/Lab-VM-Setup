# Setting up a Virtual Machine

In this lab, we'll set up a VM (virtual machine) for you to use for the
remainder of the semester.

Before you get started, please make sure you can log in to the CS network
machines. (`ssh USERNAME@stargate.cs.usfca.edu`). If you can't, contact
CS support in person or via email (support@cs.usfca.edu) immediately.

## Prerequisites
1. [Passwordless ssh](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/ssh.html)
   access to the CS network from your machine. This means you can `ssh` between machines
   in the CS network without typing a password each time. If you haven't set this up already, click the link for a guide.
2. If you are a Windows user, please install the
   [Ubuntu Terminal for Windows 10](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0).
   This gives you a Linux development environment on your Windows machine so
   that you can follow class tutorials using the same steps as the Mac/Linux
   users in class.

Done with that? Ok, moving right along...


## Lab Notebook

As you work through the following guide, you will encounter terminology, commands,
and concepts that you probably haven't seen before. Make a list of **4** such
concepts below (one per group member), and include a paragraph or two explaining
what they are used for.

1. Terminology/command/concept 1 -- Explanation.
2. Terminology/command/concept 2 -- Explanation.
3. Terminology/command/concept 3 -- Explanation.
4. Terminology/command/concept 4 -- Explanation.


## Setup Guide

Use the [VM Setup Guide](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/vm-setup.html)
to create your shiny new virtual machine. **Please read the instructions
carefully**. There is plenty of time to complete the lab, so don't rush it.

## Team IDs

Please enter each team member's CS 326 ID number below:

* Name 1: ID 1
* Name 2: ID 2
* Name 3: ID 3
* Name 4: ID 4

## Grading

To get credit for this lab, you must:

1. Fill in your team's CS 326 IDs above
2. Show us that your whole team can log in to their VMs directly via
   an ssh alias without entering a password first.
3. Have one of the course staff run our VM test script to verify your VM is
   configured correctly.
4. Show us your lab notebook above and be prepared to explain each item in detail.

# Lab 1: Setting up a Virtual Machine

In this lab, we'll set up a VM (virtual machine) for you to use for the
remainder of the semester.

Before you get started, please make sure you can log in to the CS network
machines. (`ssh USERNAME@stargate.cs.usfca.edu`). If you can't, contact
CS support in person or via email (support@cs.usfca.edu) immediately.

## Prerequisites
1. Your development machine
2. [Passwordless ssh](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/ssh.html)
   access to the CS network from your machine. If you haven't set this up
   already, click the link for a guide.
3. If you are a Windows user, please install the
   [Ubuntu Terminal for Windows 10](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0).
   This gives you a Linux development environment on your Windows machine so
   that you can follow class tutorials using the same steps as the Mac/Linux
   users in class.

Done with that? Ok, moving right along...


## Setup Guide

Use the [VM Setup Guide](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/vm-setup.html)
to create your shiny new virtual machine. **Please read the instructions
carefully**. There is plenty of time to complete the lab, so don't rush it.


## Grading

To get credit for this lab, you must:

1. Show us that you can log in to your VM directly from your local machine via
   an ssh alias without entering a password first.
2. Have one of the course staff run our VM test script to verify your VM is
   configured correctly.

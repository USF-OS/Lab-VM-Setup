# Setting up a Virtual Machine

In this lab, we'll set up a VM (virtual machine) for you to use for the
remainder of the semester.

Before you get started, please make sure you can log in to the CS network
machines. (`ssh USERNAME@stargate.cs.usfca.edu`). If you can't, contact
CS support in person or via email (support@cs.usfca.edu) immediately.

## Prerequisites
1. [Passwordless ssh](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/ssh.html)
   access to the CS network from your machine. This means you can `ssh` between machines
   in the CS network without typing a password each time. If you haven't set this up already, click the link for a guide.
2. If you are a Windows user, please install the
   [Ubuntu Terminal for Windows 10](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0).
   This gives you a Linux development environment on your Windows machine so
   that you can follow class tutorials using the same steps as the Mac/Linux
   users in class.
      * Alternatively, the latest versions of windows will let you install OpenSSH. That may be all you need.
      * Older versions of Windows will need an SSH client, such as PuTTY or MobaXTerm.

Done with that? Ok, moving right along...

## Lab Notebook

As you work through the guide linked below, you will probably see some commands you've already
used in previous classes. Please list each command that you've already seen in a new file in
this repo named `username-commands.txt`. For example, my `mmalensek-commands.txt` might contain:
```
bash
ls
cd
```

## Setup Guide

Use the [VM Setup Guide](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/cs326/schedule/materials/vm-setup.html)
to create your shiny new virtual machine. **Please read the instructions
carefully**. There is plenty of time to complete the lab, so don't rush it.
